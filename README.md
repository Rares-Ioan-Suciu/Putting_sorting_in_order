# Putting_sorting_in_order
Project used to analyze multiple sorting algorithms and their time consumptions on different types of data distribution. The project's scope is to enable the user to make a concious choice when it comes to choosing a sorting algorithm  in different situation. The user calls the program in the terminal using as arguments the directory where the analyzer program is stored, where the csv will be stored and the directory where the python program is stored.
Afterwards, the user can choose out of 12 sorting algorithms that are included in differnt categorie, such as: O(n^2) (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort), O(nlogn) (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort), Non-comparison algorithms (counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort) and Hybrid algorithms( Introsort, Timsort). 
Then, the user can choose between seven types of data distribution: 
Sorted - the integers are sorted,
Reverse - same as above, but the data is sorted in reverse order, 
Unique - the integers are randomly ordered and there are no duplicates,
Non-unique - same as above, but there can exist duplicates,
Negative - the numbers are al negative,
Almost sorted - the integers are put in order, but there is some disorder
Sparse - 70% of the integers genrated have the value 0.
